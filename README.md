# GUIbasedSearchEngine

This is a mini project which has a Web Crawler and the front end written in Java and for the back-end SQL is used. The crawler indexes and stores the data in a database (H2 database). The users can then provide a search key to search among the indexed pages.


The login window is where the users can sign up/sign in. This is a common login window for both - the users and the admin.

Once the admin signs in, he/she can give a URL to start the crawler. The admin is also entitled to view the search history of users and their feedbacks.
